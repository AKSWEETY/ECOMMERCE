E-Commerce with Social Media is a platform combining social networking and e-commerce. It has two key user roles: Admin and User.

Admin: Manages product listings, service locations, sale packages, and user orders.
User: Can sign up via OTP, manage friends and groups, create and interact with posts, and purchase products. Users can also purchase sale packages to control product visibility and complete transactions.
The project is built with Python, MySQL, and a front-end stack of CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, developed in PyCharm and managed with MySQL Workbench.
